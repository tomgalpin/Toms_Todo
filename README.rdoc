For my second project at [General Assembly's Web Development Immersive (WDI) ][https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive/san-francisco] I created a responsive todo list using only CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.  With this list, one can easily switch between days, change colors schemes, flip the card, and add and delete tasks.
